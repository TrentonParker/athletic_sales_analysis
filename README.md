# module 5 challenge

**This is my repository for the Module 5 Challenge, 'athletic_sales_analysis'. I was able to manipulate the data with the groupby and pivot_table functions pretty easily, and I'm super happy with how quickly I was able to do this one. I only got really caught up once, and after stepping away from my computer for a bit and taking a look with fresh eyes I was able to identify that I was simply missing the 'aggfunc' part of calling a pivot table for the first women's footwear table. This felt a lot easier than the past challenges, but once again, maybe I'm just finally catching on!**
